# Website utils

This repository contains different tools that can be used in websites that need to connect with SLINGR apps in the
backend.

### slingr-ws.js

This library contains the functionality to access the API of SLINGR apps. The following variables can be set when
using the library:

- `slingr.ws.API_URL`: this should be the URL of the app you will connect. For example, `https://appname.slingrs.io/dev/runtime/api`
- `slingr.ws.TOKEN`: this is the public token that will be used to authenticate through the API.
